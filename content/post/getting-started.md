## Mon premier blog

<<<<<<< HEAD
I like markdown formatting, it's a pretty interessant way to make analysis. To make analysis, we are doing charts so we learned how to make good charts and how to make analysis. For an exemple, we learned some way to compare different species with some "test" like Anova , Student,...
We learned too how to make statistics, so it's really usefull to make our analysis
=======
J'adore le language markdown, c'est utile et pratique.
